# Forecast.io
Forecast.io is a script, that is able to continually parse data from Forecast.io selected places. It stores data locally in an MySQL database and pushes it to the analytical platform as an updating stream. It also offers a script to push historical weather (forecast) data from MySQL to analytical platform.

WeatherOnline and OpenWeatherMap parsers are also included, but they have not been maintained since 2014.
